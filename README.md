## Overview
This project was completed as part of the Data Mining (CSE 6506) course at BUET for the April 2024 semester. It introduces an ultra-lightweight neural network (based on MobileNetV2 and SE) to classify mulberry leaf diseases from images among three categories: leaf spot, leaf rust, and disease-free. We used a publicly available dataset from Rajshahi, the principal sericulture region in Bangladesh. Grad-CAM was applied to validate the model's predictions. After five-fold cross-validation, our approach outperformed the base MobileNetV2 despite being extremely lightweight (145K parameters).

## Highlights
- Regional dataset
- Multi-class classification (**leaf spot, leaf rust, disease-free**)
- Efficient model with **145K parameters**
- **Grad-CAM** explainability analysis
